				<h1>Julia Neumann</h1>

				<p>
					I am a Fullstack Developer, about to graduate from the Full
					Stack Web Development Bootcamp of Spiced Academy. I have a
					background in Marketing and have been working on FAANG
					projects at the event agency KOERNER Eventkommunikation GmbH
					from 2015 to 2020. During that time I taught myself HTML and
					CSS in the context of email marketing and loved it. I was in
					charge of the digital communication for events in DACH,
					including work with CMS systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					I used this crazy year to take a deep dive into Web
					Development and I canâ€™t wait to apply what I learned in your
					company!
